[Page Object Desing Pattern](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PageObject.html) is applied while developing automated test scenarios against applications that has User Interface elements such as Web Page, Mobile Page etc. While implementing the design pattern to your automation project, naming convention for classes and interfaces  and consistency of the pattern are critical point especially for software that has more than one modules. These critical points could be smoothly handled and applied with this [maven plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/) **(page-object-validator)**. And, code quality and consistency are protected with it.
